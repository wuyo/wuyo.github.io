<p>When I was a kid, I am always admiring the anti-virus software and “playing” with them. Because at that time, I feel the anti-virus software is so cool. Now, I am finally can learn about how virus and AV works.</p>

<p>In this week, I learn about some history of malware. It is interesting to know that the first malware is actually not for bad purpose, is for protect purpose, to prevent the software being pirate. I’ve also learned some general virus analysis for AV company. For example, the file hash and the Microsoft official signature. This is the primary scanning technique for AV to identify the file is a virus or not. Before, I thought the AV will truly open the file in order to check the file is being infected or not. But then it comes the problem, how can AV do it some quickly? In reality, the AV multiple files in one second. With hashing and signature, everything will make more sense now. The AV can just compare the hash value and signature with their database to identify each file. Hash value also useful to identify the mutation of the specific kind of malware more quickly. Besides, the definition “Goat” is kind of interesting term for me. Because it implicitly shows the meaning of “goat” which is a real physical machine prepare to be infected. Just like a goat prepare to be slaughtered. The lecture also teaches me the general rule to send the malware: Rename the malware to its hash value and end with extension type bin. Then compress it with password “infected”. </p>

<p>It is fortunate to know that there are many tools that can help to analyze the malware. For examples from this week, AntiSpy, Flypaper, FakeNet, Process Monitor, Process Explorer, FileInsight. At first, I use it blindly to start doing the homework1 and it turns out the windows explorer always crash after launch those tools. Then I started to complain about the virtual machine is not good enough. I tried and tried and realized that the Flypaper will prevent program exit. Thus, when I use flypaper, I use process explorer instead of process monitor, problem solved. It is pity that I cannot figure out the real purpose of the sample malware due to the limited malware analyze knowledge. However, during the process of doing homework 1, I started to learn the general pattern that how malware infected the system and learns its behaviors: Load system dynamic library to gain more access to the system in order to launch other activities; Copy itself to other location and rename itself similar to system file to prevent deletion, then create schedule task to launch itself periodically; Try to communicate with the outside world and waiting to update the malware itself or complete other actions. Last, try to hide the other files to cover the tracks. I believe with the future lectures; I will lean more technique to figure out the real purpose of the malware. </p>
