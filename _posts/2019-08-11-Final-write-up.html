<h2 class="section-heading">Hack The Box</h2>
  <p>
    So, is time to do the real thing after learning so much knowledge of computer secuirty. Let's do some hacking challenge. To do the challenges, we need to register Hackthebox account first. After clicking the link that shows
    the registration link, the website rediret to another page that shown below.
    </p>

  <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/final/box/invite_box.JPG">
  <span class="caption text-muted">Redirect Page</span>

  <p>
    The first thing that come to my mind is the invite code should be offer by the school, but the fact is, nothing was given. Then I finally realize that the challenge is actually already begun. I need to find the way to acquire the invide code myself.
    Then, I open up the chrome built-in developer console and tried to inspect any specious elements or javascipts that can be used. I then notice a specious element arrtibutes as the image show below.
    </p>

    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/final/box/box_token.JPG">
    <span class="caption text-muted">An element with "hidden" attribute</span>

  <p>
    Thus, I manually delete the "hidden" attribute, then the interface changes to the image shown below
    </p>

    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/final/box/box_token_show.JPG">
    <span class="caption text-muted">Hidden Token shown after delete the "hidden" attribute</span>

  <p>
    Then, I try to signup with the token that show in the white box. And of course, it did not work. It is obvious that the invite code has nothing to do with the token. Then, I start digging the javascripts to see if there are any hints or somehting else is
    useful. Then I notice there is a javascript file called "inviteapi.min.js". After open the javascipts, the code in the script is clearly has been obfuscated which makes the code really hard to understand. Next, I copied all the code the the oneline javascipt
    deobfuscation website to see if it can deobfusted. Fortunatelly, it works.
    </p>

    <span class="caption text-muted">Javascipt after Deobfuscation</span>

    <p>
      As we can see from the image above, there is a function called "makeInviteCode" in the javascript. What if I try to call this function in the Chrome console? The magic happend, the website server retrun an encrypted message with ROT13 cipher.
      Copy the message to the ROT13 ciper decoder, we can get the original message "In order to generate the invite code, make a POST request to /api/invite/generate"
      </p>

    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/final/box/message_decode.JPG">
    <span class="caption text-muted">Original Message after decode with ROT13 decoder</span>

    <p>
      From the orignal messge, we can know that to accquire a invite code, we need to make a POST request to the hackthebox.eu/api/invite/generate. Withmy past experience with cloud development, we can use a tool clled "Postman" to make a POST request.
      After making the POST request with Postman, we recieved another message that maybe is the invite code. However, there is another data that comes along with the responde. "Format":"encoded". From this data and combine with the code itself, it is
      extremely likely that the invite code is encrypted. This prove my guess after trying to decode the message with base64 decoder.
      </p>

      <span class="caption text-muted">Final Invite Code after decode with base64</span>

    <p>
      After fill in the decoded invite code, we can finally register the account.
      </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reverse Engineering</h2>
  <p>
    The first reverse Engineering Challenge I pick was "Find the Easy Pass". The goal of the challenge is straight enough - find the password.
    </p>

    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/final/easy.JPG">
    <span class="caption text-muted">Challenge Objective</span>

  <p>
    The program is a standard PE file that run under windows environment. To debug the program, we need the windows debugger - WinDbg. However, we need somehting more powerful and convienet tool that can help us to crack the password. Thus, here, we use IDA -The Interactive Disassembler.
    Since we dont know that the exact password, so let's input something special string that will be useful to future debugging. So, let's enter "fake" in the dialoge box, to see what will happen. As the image shown below, after input the wrong password, the program will prompt "Wrong password!"
    </p>

    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/final/easypass/wrong.jpg">
    <span class="caption text-muted">Prompt after Enter The Wrong Password</span>

  <p>
    So, let's try to search the string "Wrong" to try to see what the program did before prompt the wrong prompt. We first need to attach the program process, switch to disassembler mode, then, we search the string "Wrong". Luckly, we easily have the result.
    And as the disassembler code image shown below, we can see before prompt the "Wrong password", the program called another function. And the most importnt is, there are also have register EAX and EDX. It is highly possible that the program will use these two register to store the user input and password, then
    compare between them. So, let's set a break point there, and then re enter the wrong password "fake".
    </p>

    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/final/easypass/function_call.jpg">
    <span class="caption text-muted">Program Execution before prompt "Wrong password!"</span>

  <p>
    After re enter the password, and from the image shown below, the EAX register do contain the string we input - "fake", and then move to the EDX register, the EDX register also contain a string - "fortran!". it is highly possible that this is the actual final password.
    </p>

    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/final/easypass/fake.jpg">
    <span class="caption text-muted">EAX register contain string that we input "fake"</span>

    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/final/easypass/final_pass.jpg">
    <span class="caption text-muted">EDX register contain string that possibly password</span>

  <p>
    So, let's try the password that we get from the EDX register. And yes, the password is correct.
    </p>

    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/final/easypass/good_job.jpg">
    <span class="caption text-muted">EDX register contain string that possibly password</span>

  <p>
    The second reverse engineering challenge that I did was called "snake". The challenge is to find the username and the password.
    </p>

    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/final/snake.JPG">
    <span class="caption text-muted">Challenge "Snake"</span>

  <p>
    The challenge is actaully a single python file, which means we can just inspect the code directly. So, here comes the question, if we can see the orignal code, we can just sovled it by directly modify the code, reveal the username and password, right?
    That's whan I was thinking at first. Let's see the code from the image shown below.
    </p>

    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/final/snake/code_password.JPG">
    <span class="caption text-muted">The part of the code</span>

  <p>
    As we can see, the username and password will be finally store in an variable "slither" and "chars", so we can just print these two varianles to the terminal to get the username and password.
    </p>

    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/final/snake/reveal.JPG">
    <span class="caption text-muted">Reveal username and password</span>

  <p>
    Then, trying to submit the hackthebox challenge flag with revealed username and password, but the website return "wrong flag". Of course, how could be that easy? So, is time to digging the code manully to see whats the real password. After spending sometime
    digging the code, an unusual part of the code got my atention. The looping at the end of the code which also responsible for the password verification is actaully only loop once. Which means the loop only verify the first character of the password - d. Which means
    the password is incorrect. After manully examinate all the variable as the image shown below, a variable name caught my attention: "keys_encrypt", which seems possibly is the actual variable that store the password.
    </p>

    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/final/snake/decode.JPG">
    <span class="caption text-muted">Manual calculate for each variable</span>

    <p>
      Finally, submit the username and the value of the variable "keys_encrypt" as the flag, and it works.
      </p>

    <h2 class="section-heading">Steganography</h2>

    <p>
      Steganography,is the practice of concealing messages within other non-secret text or data. The cover media may appear unremarkable at first glance and will require close investigation. For the third hackthebox challenge, I did the steganography challenge.
      </p>
      <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/final/uni.JPG">
      <span class="caption text-muted">Steganography Challenge</span>

    <p>
      The goal of this challenge is to find the hidden flag in a file that contain the text file, the content of the file as shown as the image below.
      </p>

      <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/final/unified/encode.jpg">
      <span class="caption text-muted">Challenge File</span>

    <p>
      As we can see, the file contain a message that pretented to be a global language message. There is a part of the string cnanot be displayed, but it is possible that the string is actually written in different languages that the unicode format just cannot read it.
      I first trying to extract the hex value of the whole file, but still doe snot gives any clues or hint. However, for this challenge, we actually need an another tool that help us to solve the challenge. Which is called Burp Suite.
      </p>

    <p>
      then we try to copy whole message to the Burp Suite decoder, then decode it, to see what will happen.
      </p>

      <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/final/unified/decode.jpg">
      <span class="caption text-muted">Decode String</span>

      <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/final/unified/decode_2.jpg">
      <span class="caption text-muted">Decode String</span>

    <p>
      After we decode the string, we can see that there is a string looks very familiar, and yes, after delete all the symbol "@", we can get  actual flag : HTB{tr1th3m1u5_1499}. Submit, and we are done
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
      From these hackthebox challenge, we can see to getting comfortable with the security area, we need to learn to use different tools, need to understand what the original author really wants and sovled things that from their perspetives.
